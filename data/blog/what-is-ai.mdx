AI refers to computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Think of it like teaching computers to learn and make decisions, similar to how we humans learn from experience.

## Core Types of AI

**Machine Learning**  

The brain of modern AI. It's like teaching a child - you show it lots of examples, and it learns patterns to make future decisions.

**Deep Learning**  

A more sophisticated form of machine learning, modeled after human brain networks. Imagine a super-detailed pattern recognition system that can identify cats in photos or understand human speech.

## How AI Works

AI systems process information through layers of analysis:

1. Data Collection - Like giving a student textbooks to study
2. Pattern Recognition - Finding connections, similar to how we spot trends
3. Decision Making - Using learned patterns to make choices

## Real-World Applications

* Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa) - Your digital helpers
* Healthcare diagnosis - Helping doctors spot diseases
* Self-driving cars - Making countless decisions while navigating
* Content recommendations - Picking your next Netflix show

## Limitations and Challenges

AI isn't magic - it has clear boundaries. It excels at specific tasks but lacks human common sense and emotional intelligence. Think of it as a highly specialized tool rather than a replacement for human judgment.

## The Future

AI continues evolving rapidly, shaping various aspects of our lives. While it won't replace human intelligence, it will increasingly augment our capabilities across industries and daily tasks.

## Impact on Society

AI brings both opportunities and responsibilities. Like any powerful tool, its benefits depend on how we choose to use it. Understanding its capabilities and limitations helps us make informed decisions about its role in our future.
